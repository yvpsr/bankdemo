# bankdemo
Developed a Bank Management System in Java with a MySQL database connection through the JDBC API.
Database structure includes two tables: Users for storing user details and Accounts for managing account-related information.
Implemented with four Java classes:
Main Class: Initializes and runs the application.
User Class: Represents user details and methods for managing user information.
Account Class: Manages account-specific attributes and operations (e.g., balance, deposits, withdrawals).
AccountManager Class: Handles all transactions and interactions between the User and Accounts classes, including database queries.
This project showcases skills in Java programming, JDBC API for database connectivity, and efficient handling of banking operations in a relational database structure.
